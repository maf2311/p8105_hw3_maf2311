# Problem 1

Instacarts Dataset Description:

The Instacart Dataset has the following variables: order_id, product_id,
add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set, order_number,
order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name,
aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department. It has 1384617 rows and 15
columns. ILLSTRATIVE EX?

-   There are 134 unique aisles, and the most items are ordered from
    aisle 150609.
-   Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.
-   Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.
-   Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
